## Highlights

- [2024-01-15] We release our toolkit together with our introductory paper. üéâ


## Repository Overview

This repository is structured into three main directories:

1. **`deployment`**: Contains scripts and configuration files essential for the *one-click* deployment of our human evaluation tool.
2. **`human_eval_tool`**: Contains the source code for our human evaluation tool. This tool is designed to facilitate human evaluation experiments of dialogue systems.
3. **`tod_system`**: Contains the source code for developing and evaluating multilingual task-oriented dialogue systems.

## How to Use

This repository provides detailed instructions in each directory, which are designed to guide you through the various aspects of our toolkit. Please refer to these to get started with our toolkit. 

1. **For ToD System Development**: If your focus is on developing dialogue systems, we have a dedicated instruction to run our baseline systems. Please see [tod_system/README.md](tod_system/README.md).

2. **For Human Evaluation Tool Customisation**: Should you wish to tailor the human evaluation tool to better suit your specific needs, instructions are available in [human_eval_tool/README.md](human_eval_tool/README.md).

3. **For One-Click Deployment**: For users interested in enjoying our one-click deployment for the human evaluation setup, deployment instructions can be found in [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md).
